## Hello from Brazil, I'm Ian.

I'm bachelor in Information Systems, front-end developer on @UpperSoft, and UI/UX lover.

I started my developer career as wordpress developer, but the more I did front-end more I loving it, so I started to focus my energies in front-end. I started to learn about JavaScript, CSS preprocessor, and js frameworks, like Vue.js.

Nowdays I work mostly with Vue.js creating beautiful PWAs, SPA and all kind of things on UpperSoft.

I have experience on JavaScript *(and Vue.js)*, SASS/LESS, PHP *(and Laravel)*, and Wordpress.

Actually I'm working to improve my knowledge in Vue.js, Nuxt.js.
