### Hello from Brazil 🇧🇷

My name is Ian and I'm bachelor in Information Systems and frontend developer.

I started my career as a full-stack developer (PHP - Laravel and Wordpress), but the greater my contact with the frontend, the more I felt I should focus my energies on this, and go deeper and deeper to make the web a better place.

After some experiences on frontend I started to focus my attention on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As time went by, I got deeper into CSS preprocessors, pure JavaScript, and Vue.js. I also acquired a passion for UI and UX, and sometimes I risk a few things in Adobe XD.

I have experience in JavaScript (Vanilla, Vue.js and Nuxt.js), SASS/LESS, PHP (Laravel), Wordpress, GitHub and GitHub Actions, Docker, CSS frameworks (Tailwind and Bootstrap), integrations with RESTful APIs and WebSocket.

I always seek to improve and share my knowledge and collaborate to bring the best web experience to everyone.
