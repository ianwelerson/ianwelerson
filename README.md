### Hello from Brazil 🇧🇷

Hi, my name is Ian Welerson.

I'm a front-end developer, graduated in Information System (FAESA), with 4+ years of experience.

I started in development area as a full-stack developer, working specifically with Wordpress, Laravel, jQuery and Bootstrap. After a short period of time I migrated to the front-end area, getting more knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (vanilla).

Currently I have knowledge in CSS pre-processors (LESS, SASS, SCSS), JavaScript (vanilla), JavaScript frameworks (Vue.js, Nuxt.js), CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap), unit tests (Jest), E2E tests (Cypress), Docker, Git and GitHub Actions.

I have already realized integrations with RESTful APIs and Websockets, for short period of time I worked as Node.js developer in a BFF (Back-end For Front-end) API. I also like UI/UX area and have some basic knowledge in Adobe XD and Figma.
