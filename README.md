### Hello from Brazil 🇧🇷

I'm Ian Welerson, a frontend developer with over seven years of experience creating user-focused web applications.

I work primarily with JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, Svelte, Next.js, HTML, CSS, and SASS. I’m also experienced with testing frameworks like Jest, Vitest, Cypress, and Playwright, and UI libraries such as Tailwind, Shadcn, and Chart.js. I focus on writing maintainable code, optimizing performance, and building accessible, reliable interfaces.

Beyond frontend development, I have experience with backend technologies including Node.js with Nest.js, GraphQL, WebSockets, RESTful APIs, and platforms like Supabase. I also work with modern development practices like Monorepo management using Turborepo and scalable architecture with Feature-Sliced Design (FSD).  
In previous roles, I served as a Tech Lead and Head of Frontend, supporting team growth and technical direction.

I've collaborated with teams across Brazil, the United States, and Australia, bringing a practical and adaptable approach to international projects.
