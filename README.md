### Hello from Brazil 🇧🇷

I'm Ian Welerson, a dedicated developer passionate about crafting exceptional user experiences. My professional journey began in full-stack development, where I honed my skills with Wordpress, Laravel, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

Transitioning to frontend development, I've immersed myself in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an array of tools, languages, and frameworks like Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Tailwind, Bootstrap, CSS pre-processors (LESS, SASS, SCSS), and TypeScript. These proficiencies lay the groundwork for creating intuitive interfaces.

Expanding my expertise, I've ventured into backend projects using Node.js (utilizing frameworks like Nest.js and Express.js) and dived into integrations with GraphQL APIs, complementing my understanding of RESTful APIs.

With experience in Brazilian and US-based companies, I've gained a broad perspective on technological challenges, fostering adaptability across diverse work environments.

Additionally, my proficiency extends to testing tools like JEST and Cypress, ensuring the reliability and quality of my deliverables.

Fueled by an enduring interest in UI/UX and bolstered by foundational knowledge in Adobe XD and Figma, I actively stay updated on industry trends, fostering a commitment to innovation.
